# neuralNetworks-DeepLearning-coursera
This repository contains my solutions, notes, and code implementations from the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng. The course dives into foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning, including forward propagation, backward propagation, and optimization techniques.
